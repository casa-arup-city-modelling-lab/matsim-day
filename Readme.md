### MATSim Day 

*Date*: Tuesday 19th December

*Venue*: Center for Applied Spatial Analysis, University College London


### Aim of the day

The learning outcome goal is for familiarity of the key concepts and an understanding of how to go about building an open MATSim model. We will be mostly learning by doing.

This course assumes no prior knowledge of MATSim (or even transport related simulations). We will go through the main components of building a MATSim model, including the creation of a toy model in a day.
